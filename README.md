## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**  
2. **Dependencies**: Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **API Keys**: Obtain the following API keys for full functionality:  
   - Google Geocoding API  
   - OpenAI API  
   - Mailtrap API

### Steps

#### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server/` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Run the server application:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Note**: The server supports both local (with CUDA-enabled GPU) and cloud-based setups (e.g., GCP). Ensure the necessary API keys are added to the environment.

#### Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client/` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Run the client application:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Configuration**: Update the server's IP address in the `main.py` file and ensure the Google Geocoding API key is correctly configured.  
4. Open the client interface and select satellite or upload drone imagery for analysis.
